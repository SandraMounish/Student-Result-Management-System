Student Result Management System (Python)

Project Overview

    The Student Result Management System is a console-based Python application designed to manage student academic records efficiently.
    It allows users to add students, record subject-wise marks, calculate grades, and generate reports with persistent data storage using file handling.
  
    This project demonstrates core Python programming concepts such as OOP, dictionaries, functions, loops, and JSON-based file handling.

 Features

    . Add new students
    
    . Add or update subject-wise marks
    
    . Automatically calculate percentage
    
    . Assign grades based on performance
    
    . Generate detailed student reports
    
    . Save and load data using JSON file
    
    . Menu-driven and user-friendly interface

 
 Technologies Used

    Python 
    
    Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
    
    Dictionaries
    
    File Handling (JSON)
    
    Functions & Control Structures

How the System Works

    User selects an option from the menu
    
    Student details and marks are entered
    
    Data is stored in students_data.json
    
    Percentage and grade are calculated automatically
    
    Student report is displayed on the screen

Grade Criteria

      Percentage	Grade
      ≥ 90%	        A
      ≥ 75%        	B
      ≥ 60%	        C
      ≥ 40%        	D
      < 40%	       Fail
